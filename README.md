Lagrangians to Lasers (L2L)

L2L is a journal club of Physics students at IISER Pune. The goal of this club is to act as a forum for people interested in different fields of physics. Students present their interests among their peers in a way that is comprehensible at the undergraduate level.
In hopes of preventing further separation between the sub-fields of physics, this club is an attempt to bridge the communication gap among our peers.
